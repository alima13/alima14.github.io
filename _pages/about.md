My passion for doing research and maintaining real advances in the area of computer science and engineering, started during my high school studies. As an student in Iran, I had the opportunity to attend to the National Kharazmi Competition (2013-2014), accompanied with a team of classmates, where I led the to an innovative project on customizing a Linux distro for Persian students. Schools in Iran at that time did not have enough computational resources. Often having computers with low resources, running Windows based applications was very hard and time-consuming for this computers. Based on the fact that Linux has more capability for enhancements, we tried to follow two objectives of keeping
the whole OS Lightweight and having Persian Language as its main language pack. Also, a set of rules and codes were developed into the OS itself for managing and receiving updates of student registration and other required information. With this project, I could receive a “Technical Confirmation” certificate from Iran’s high council of Informatics (Highest national council responsible for IT and Software related
decisions) at the age of 16. 

Our project got selected as the national nominee for “World Summit Awards – 2015” at the Inclusion and Empowerment sector, and ranked among the 48 projects and outstanding innovations worldwide by this UN organization.

After admitting to the university for my bachelor studies, I started to build up a team again. This time the team consisted of 3 developers, with a shared passion for thinking out of the box, building software solutions that create impact for the others. Our team participated at a contest at “Finnova” innovation center pre-acceleration pitch round and got selected as the only nominee from all IAU campuses. This time we started working on developing a data-centric solution for tracking and automating marketing tasks. The whole process of platform development took almost a year, but having a modern technology stack, on top of Node.js, Kafka, ELK empowered with K8s orchestration, the platform could survive and capture big customers from Iraninan market. Snapp and some international companies were our first adaptors.

From this point I joined Snapp Group as a consultant. Snapp is the most successful ride hailing company in Iran and has more than 25M installs. I worked as their consultant for building up an advertising/automation stack for optimizing their marketing journeys. Here
I used both my technical background from my own startup, and research background, on using Markov decision processes for detecting and processing users attribution trajectories.

Meanwhile, a research internship position on IoT and distributed sensor networks, grabbed
my attention. At the time I was preparing my Masters Thesis Proposal and joining this internship program meant an opportunity to deepen my knowledge on distributed machine
learning.
